**Data Analysis of User Behavior, Cooking Preferences, and Order Trends**
***Objective***:

The objective of this project is to analyze datasets related to user behavior, cooking preferences, and order trends. The project involves cleaning, merging, and analyzing three datasets: UserDetails, CookingSessions, and OrderDetails. The insights gained will help understand the relationship between cooking sessions, user orders, popular dishes, and demographic factors that influence user behavior.

***Dataset***:

The data consists of three main datasets:

**UserDetails**: Contains demographic information about users.

**CookingSessions**: Includes details about cooking sessions, such as session duration and ratings.

**OrderDetails**: Contains information about user orders, including dish names and order amounts.

**Data Cleaning and Merging**:

The data was cleaned and merged using PowerQuery in Excel. After merging, it was analyzed using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to identify key insights.

**Analysis**:

***1. Session and Order Analysis***:
The relationship between session duration, ratings, and order frequency was analyzed.

***2. Popular Dishes***:
The top dishes were identified based on the number of orders.

***3. Demographic Analysis***:

A demographic analysis was conducted to examine orders by age group and location.
***4. Data Visualizations***:

**Key insights were visualized using bar plots, showcasing:**

->The top 10 popular dishes.

->Orders by age group.

**Key Findings**:

***1-Session and Order Analysis:*** Users who rated their cooking sessions highly tend to place more orders.

***2-Popular Dishes:*** Certain dishes are more frequently ordered, indicating their popularity.

***3-Demographics:*** The majority of orders come from young adults and adults, with specific locations showing higher order volumes.

**Business Recommendations**:

1- Focus marketing efforts on promoting popular dishes.

2- Offer tailored promotions for different age groups.

3- Expand the availability of high-demand dishes in locations with higher order volumes.

**Technologies Used**:

***1- Python:*** For data analysis and visualization (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

***2- Excel:*** For data cleaning and merging using PowerQuery

**Files**:

***data_analysis.py:*** Python script containing the data analysis code.

***merge2.xlsx:*** Excel file used for data cleaning and merging.

***README.md:*** This file.

**How to Run**:
Place the cleaned and merged Excel file (merge2.xlsx) in the same directory as data_analysis.py.

**Run the script:**

python data_analysis.py
